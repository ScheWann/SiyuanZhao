# Some my stories

- In junior high school, my first exam ranking was 182/230. I did not realize that is a bad grade, I just think I was a 'mid-level' student in school, and it was enough for me. But my mother was anxious and angry about it.

- When I was in senior high school, I did not understand how to study. Just remember everything I learned and did a lot of practice like a machine. Although I was not so bad in senior high school, I still was not the top student, and became a real 'mid-level' student and went to a 'mid-level' university.

- I decided to change myself and tried not to be a quiet person in the class, so I joined the Students' Union. But I found that it is no meaning after graduation, there is no company that cares about your activity in the Students' Union. It seems like I have wasted some time, but I don't regret it because I believe that everything in the world has its own meaning.

- In college, all learning is up to you. I became that person who likes going to the library the most. I am curious about the 'definitions' behind some of the lectures, but these definitions often are the knowledge that will not be covered or tested in the class. But I just simply want to understand why.

- I became a little â€˜lecturer' to my classmates before the final exam, but strangely they all got better grades than me. I've been struggling with this for a while, but I think it's because I'm still not good enough, I have to harder than before.

- I love math because I think the results that can be calculated are the most realistic.

- I remember my first class was C programming and design in my freshman year. After that class I secretly decided that I must never do any job about programming in the future.

- But in my sophomore year, I realized that people don't do everything they want. And programming wasn't that bad, so I did my first internship as a front-end engineer.

- It was really bad in the beginning and I had a hard time solving the tasks the team assigned me. But I don't want to be the one that drags down the team, this pressure gave me growth and opened the door to computer science for me.

- In my third year of college, I gradually understood what learning is. I like to study the whole picture of something, to delve into everything like the root. But I also didn't have time to focus on the full range of exams, which resulted in some of my grades not being as good.

- That same year, the Operations Research professor gave each group a task, and whichever group could complete it would get a 25 percent performance score. That was the first time I was most involved. I sat in front of the computer for 9 hours without knowing it, and I completed this question on the first night and got full marks.

- I decided to pursue a Master's degree in the US. In order to study quietly, I moved into a little room of about 100fz^2.

- Because of the study pressure and confusion about the future, 2019 has been the most painful time for me so far.

- In early 2020, the Covid-19 broke out, this made me miss my graduation ceremony.

- In March 2021, I took my second work as a Full-Stack Engineer, I found I was busy in complete each deadline and repleted work. Each part could not be completed perfectly, but most people do not care about that, so I found that is not the life that I want, I pursued a life full of improvement, so I decide to be Ph.D..
