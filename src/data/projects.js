      "To enhance the diagnosis and management of patients with severe epilepsy, it's imperative to detect epileptic seizures using EEG signals from multiple electrodes accurately. This project endeavors to introduce a sophisticated visual analysis tool. This will empower physicians to more accurately determine the origin and the intracranial propagation pathways of epileptic activity."

      "In this visualization, the map is bifurcated into two distinct sections to represent states and counties, offering a nuanced view of gun death distribution across these geographical divisions. It incorporates a packed bubble chart to articulate extensive data from large U.S. counties and a stacked bar chart that provides in-depth information for each state. Adding to its interactivity and detailed exploration, an interactive scatter plot reveals statistics about male and female victims of gun deaths when a state on the map is selected, thereby enhancing the overall clarity and effectiveness of the visualization."
