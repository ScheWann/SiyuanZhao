I am particularly interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data visualization, and Computer Vision. Now I am a 2023Fall PhD Applicant.\n\n# Education\n\n- Worcester Polytechnic Institute   08/2021 - present\n- Shandong University of Finance and Economic   08/2016 - 06/2020\n\n# Experience\n\n- U.S. Army DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory, Research Intern    08/2022 - present\n- Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Research Assistant   02/2022 - 05/2022\n- Hsoft Corporation, Full-Stack Engineer Intern   03/2021 - 06/2021\n- Kumi Corporation, Front-End Engineer Intern   01/2019 - 04/2019\n\n# Some my stories\n\n- In junior high school, my first exam ranking was 182/230. I did not realize that is a bad grade, I just think I was a 'mid-level' student in school, and it was enough for me. But my mother was anxious and angry about it.\n\n- When I was in senior high school, I did not understand how to study. Just remember everything I learned and did a lot of practice like a machine. Although I was not so bad in senior high school, I still was not the top student, and became a real 'mid-level' student and went to a 'mid-level' university.\n\n- I decided to change myself and tried not to be a quiet person in the class, so I joined the Students' Union. But I found that it is no meaning after graduation, there is no company that cares about your activity in the Students' Union. It seems like I have wasted some time, but I don't regret it because I believe that everything in the world has its own meaning.\n\n- In college, all learning is up to you. I became that person who likes going to the library the most. I am curious about the 'definitions' behind some of the lectures, but these definitions often are the knowledge that will not be covered or tested in the class. But I just simply want to understand why.\n\n- I became a little \u2018lecturer' to my classmates before the final exam, but strangely they all got better grades than me. I've been struggling with this for a while, but I think it's because I'm still not good enough, I have to harder than before.\n\n- I love math because I think the results that can be calculated are the most realistic.\n\n- I remember my first class was C programming and design in my freshman year. After that class I secretly decided that I must never do any job about programming in the future.\n\n- But in my sophomore year, I realized that people don't do everything they want. And programming wasn't that bad, so I did my first internship as a front-end engineer.\n\n- It was really bad in the beginning and I had a hard time solving the tasks the team assigned me. But I don't want to be the one that drags down the team, this pressure gave me growth and opened the door to computer science for me.\n\n- In my third year of college, I gradually understood what learning is. I like to study the whole picture of something, to delve into everything like the root. But I also didn't have time to focus on the full range of exams, which resulted in some of my grades not being as good.\n\n- That same year, the Operations Research professor gave each group a task, and whichever group could complete it would get a 25 percent performance score. That was the first time I was most involved. I sat in front of the computer for 9 hours without knowing it, and I completed this question on the first night and got full marks.\n\n- I decided to pursue a Master's degree in the US. In order to study quietly, I moved into a little room of about 100fz^2.\n\n- Because of the study pressure and confusion about the future, 2019 has been the most painful time for me so far.\n\n- In early 2020, the Covid-19 broke out, this made me miss my graduation ceremony.\n\n- In March 2021, I took my second work as a Full-Stack Engineer, I found I was busy in complete each deadline and repleted work. Each part could not be completed perfectly, but most people do not care about that, so I found that is not the life that I want, I pursued a life full of improvement, so I decide to be Ph.D..\n\n\n# I like\n\n- Swimming\n- Travel\n- Cooking\n- Sea\n- Summer\n- Books and more books\n- Movies\n- Comics\n- Good design\n- Photography\n\n# I dream of\n\n- got PhD degree.\n- always finding inspiration.\n- enabling a brighter future.\n- doing better.\n- keep thinking.",l=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,u=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},e);return(0,h.jsx)(a.rU,(0,o.Z)({},t))};t.default=function(){return(0,h.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Siyuan Zhao",children:(0,h.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,h.jsx)("header",{children:(0,h.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,h.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,h.jsx)(a.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,h.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),(0,h.jsx)(r(),{source:d,renderers:{Link:u},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
